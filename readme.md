Unity Sound Synthesizer

To Do (not in order):
---------------------
1. Optimize keyframe navigation, can aggresivly cache position
2. Add passthrough filters
3. Add noise patterns
4. Add support for stereo
5. Support different instructions for each channel in stereo mode
6. Add keyframe mode option, either set or lerp to determine if should interpolate between keys
7. Look at alternative serialization schemas
8. Add data binding / parameterization method. Preferably add range mapping from input to output on binder
9. Some GUI would be nice
